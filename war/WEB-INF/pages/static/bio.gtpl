<p>I've become interested in Groovy while working for Nokia in Berlin in Spring 2010. I liked it so much that I decided to shift my career towards web development with Grails. I'm really happy to have made that decision back then as Groovy ecosystem is not only full of good projects but it's also full of friendly and outstanding developers. That's why I like going to conferences focused on Groovy and sometimes even become a speaker at them. </p>

<p>I believe in Open Source Software and have a strong need to give back to the community whenever possible especially as I make a living using Grails which is an open source project. That's why I'm proud to be one of the core commiters of Geb. I've also managed to get few pull requests accepted into Grails codebase.</p>

<p>I've worked in four different countries (Poland, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom) with different technologies and languages (from Java through Javascript, Python and Ruby to Groovy) and developed my skills over the years. I believe that software should not only work, but also has to be 'beautiful under the hood', maintainable, well-tested and the source code should be clean and consistent. And I can't imagine coding without doing TDD anymore...</p>
